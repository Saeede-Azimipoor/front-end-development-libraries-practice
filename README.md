# React Practice

This repository contains my React practice projects while learning through [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/react/).  
I’m building small components and apps to improve my skills and get ready for professional front-end development work in Canada 🇨🇦.

## What’s inside:

- ✅ JSX Basics
- ✅ Functional Components
- 🔄 Props and State (In Progress)
- 🔄 Event Handling
- 🔄 Small Apps (To-Do, Weather, etc.)
