# React Practice Projects ðŸ’»ðŸŒ¸

This repository contains my step-by-step practice while learning **React** through the **Front-End Development Libraries** course on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/react/).  
Each folder includes focused exercises on a core concept, structured to reflect real progress and skill building.

Each snippet is self-contained and runnable in a simple React app (e.g., CodeSandbox or Create React App).
